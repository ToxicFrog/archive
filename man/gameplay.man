The game itself starts with two ships randomly located on the starfield with a sun in the center (Warning: allowing your ship to drift into the sun will result in destroying your ship). To move both ships the Thrust Button* will power your ships and will accelerate them in the direction that the ships are pointing.  Using the Rotate Buttons* will rotate your ship either left or right, and together with thrust will manoeuver your ship where you desire to go. Now this game is about destroying your opponent so of course there's weapons. Basically there are two types of weapons, high velocity projectiles and  missiles. High velocity projectile weapons are any weapon that is not homing, while missile type weapons are. To use the High velocity projectile weapons just aim towards your target and press the Fire Primary Button* or if you want to use a missile type weapon press the Fire Secondary Button* and you can see the missile type weapon  manoeuver toward your target. Throughout the game there are multiple types of missile weapons and high velocity weapons. You can toggle through the different types by pressing the Change Primary Button* for the high velocity weapons and Change Secondary Button* for the missile type weapons. Or you can find all this out by just playing around . Either way Have Fun!!!
