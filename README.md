This repo is an archive of abandoned projects, mostly stuff originally released on www.ancilla.ca or www.funkyhorror.net, or on forums via dropbox hosting. Each branch in this repo is a distinct project with no shared history.

A lot of these projects predate my use of version control. Where multiple releases are available I've tried to reconstruct at least some of the version history, but in many cases there is only a single commit, that being the sole surviving release of the software.

Here is a list of all branches in this repo (other than master, which contains this text):

cubik     - a simple pattern-matching game
gifttank  - a simple top-down shooter
moonpak   - an unpacker for Moonpod Games packfiles
shockmap  - render System Shock maps to HTML (prototype C implementation)
spacewar  - a clone of the classic game with some extra features, written in Turing 4
ss1hr     - a patch to enable high (800x600 & 1024x768) resolution rendering in System Shock 1
unmpak4   - an unpacker for Massive Entertainment packfiles
