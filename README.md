This repo is an archive of abandoned projects, mostly stuff originally released on www.ancilla.ca or www.funkyhorror.net, or on forums via dropbox hosting. Each branch namespace in this repo is a distinct project, so to get, say, the master branch of the cubik project, you'd check out cubik/master.

A lot of these projects predate my use of version control. Where multiple releases are available I've tried to reconstruct at least some of the version history, but in many cases there is only a single commit on master, that being the sole surviving release of the software.
